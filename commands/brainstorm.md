The user is starting a new project and needs help pulling ideas out of their head.

If the user provided a description: $ARGUMENTS

Interview them about this project, one category at a time, in this order:

1. **Problem** — What problem does this solve? Who has it? How are they dealing with it now?
2. **Audience** — Who specifically is this for? What do they care about? What don't they care about?
3. **Success** — What does "done" look like? How will we measure success?
4. **Scope** — What's in and what's explicitly out?
5. **Constraints** — Budget, timeline, tech stack, team skills, org politics?
6. **Prior art** — What's been tried? What similar things exist?
7. **Risks** — What could go wrong? What's most uncertain?

Rules:
- Ask 2-3 questions per category, then WAIT for answers before moving on.
- If an answer is vague, push back and ask for specifics.
- After all categories, produce a structured summary and flag any contradictions or gaps.
- Save the summary to `docs/brainstorm-notes.md`.
