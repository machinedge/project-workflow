<!-- TEMPLATE: Synthesis Command
     This command runs at the end of a major work unit (milestone/phase).
     It pulls together everything that happened and produces a final assessment
     or deliverable.

     SWE calls this "/postmortem" — reviews what was learned, updates the plan.
     EDA calls this "/synthesize" — pulls findings into a recommendations report.

     The output depends on your domain:
       - For SWE-like workflows: a retrospective that updates the roadmap
       - For EDA-like workflows: a deliverable report for stakeholders
       - For other workflows: whatever the appropriate capstone is

     Replace all {{PLACEHOLDER}} markers.
     Delete these comments when done.

The user has completed a {{WORK_UNIT}} and wants to review and synthesize the results.

If the user specified which {{WORK_UNIT}}: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Gather Everything

Read:
1. `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}`
2. `docs/{{PLAN_DOC}}`
3. All handoff notes for sessions in this {{WORK_UNIT}}
4. All GitHub issues for this {{WORK_UNIT}} (including review findings)
5. The work products produced

<!-- GUIDE: Add domain-specific inputs. EDA reads notebooks and data profiles.
     SWE reads the codebase. Your workflow might have its own. -->

---

## Step 2: Assess

<!-- GUIDE: Customize these assessment questions for your domain.

     For SWE-like workflows, ask:
       - What was planned vs. what was delivered?
       - What was learned that changes downstream plans?
       - What technical debt was incurred?

     For EDA-like workflows, ask:
       - What did we find?
       - What are the recommendations?
       - What's the confidence level?

     For other workflows, ask:
       - Did we achieve the {{WORK_UNIT}} goal?
       - What surprised us?
       - What should change going forward? -->

Assess the completed {{WORK_UNIT}}:

1. **Goal vs. Reality** — Did we achieve what we set out to do?
2. **Key Findings** — What were the most important results or discoveries?
3. **Surprises** — What was unexpected? What assumptions were wrong?
4. **Lessons** — What should we do differently in the next {{WORK_UNIT}}?
5. **Impact on Plan** — Does anything downstream need to change?

---

## Step 3: Produce Output

<!-- GUIDE: Customize the output for your domain.

     For SWE: Update project-brief.md and roadmap.md with lessons learned.
     For EDA: Produce a synthesis report in reports/.
     For other: Whatever the appropriate capstone deliverable is. -->

Produce the synthesis output and present it to the user for review.

---

## Step 4: Update Documents

- Update `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}` with the {{WORK_UNIT}} completion and any revised plans.
- Update `docs/{{PLAN_DOC}}` if downstream {{WORK_UNIT}}s need adjustment.
- Add any new lessons to `docs/lessons-log.md`.

Rules:
- Be honest about what was delivered vs. what was planned.
- Revise downstream estimates based on what was learned. Optimism is not a plan.
- Present the synthesis to the user and wait for approval before saving.
