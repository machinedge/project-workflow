<!-- TEMPLATE: Decompose Skill
     This skill breaks a work unit (milestone/phase) into session-sized
     tasks. Each task represents one /start session worth of work.

     Tasks use the user story format and are tracked in the `issues/`
     directory as local files. This keeps everything in-repo.

     Replace {{PLAN_DOC}} with the plan file.
     Replace {{BRIEF_DOC}} with the brief file.
     Replace {{WORK_UNIT}} with your domain term (milestone, phase, etc.).
     Replace {{ISSUE_LABEL}} with the label for tasks (e.g., "task", "analysis").
     Delete these comments when done.

The user wants to break a {{WORK_UNIT}} into individual tasks.

If the user specified a {{WORK_UNIT}}: $ARGUMENTS

Read `docs/{{PLAN_DOC}}` and `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}`.

If the user didn't specify which {{WORK_UNIT}}, check the brief's "Current Status" section or ask them.

Break the {{WORK_UNIT}} into session-sized tasks. Each task should be completable in a single `/start` session.

For each task, create an issue file in the `issues/` directory:

Save to `issues/NNN-[short-slug].md` (zero-padded, e.g. `issues/001-setup-auth.md`):

```markdown
# [Short, descriptive title]

**Label:** {{ISSUE_LABEL}}
**Status:** open

## User Story
As a [specific persona], I [need/want] [capability] so that [value].

## Description
[2-3 sentences explaining the work]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion phrased from the persona's perspective]
- [ ] [Another criterion — what can the user do or see?]
- [ ] [Keep to 3-5 criteria]

## Technical Notes
**Estimated effort:** [Small / Medium / Large]
**Dependencies:** [Issue numbers, or "None"]
```

After creating all issues, present a summary table:

```
| # | Title | Effort | Dependencies |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
```

Rules:
- Each task should take one session. If it feels like more, break it down further.
- User stories use specific personas, not "user" or "developer."
- Acceptance criteria describe what the persona can do or see, not implementation details.
  - Good: "Warehouse manager can filter orders by date range"
  - Bad: "Implement date range filter SQL query"
- Sequence tasks so dependencies flow forward (no circular dependencies).
- Present the plan to the user and wait for approval before creating issue files.
