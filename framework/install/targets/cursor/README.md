# Cursor Target

Translation rules for generating Cursor configurations from platform-agnostic expert definitions.

Currently, the Cursor translation logic lives inline in `install.sh`. This directory is the future home for extracted, modular translation configs.

**Output paths:** `.cursor/rules/*-os.mdc`, `.cursor/commands/*.md`, `.cursor/rules/project-os.mdc`
