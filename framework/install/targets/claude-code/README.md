# Claude Code Target

Translation rules for generating Claude Code configurations from platform-agnostic expert definitions.

Currently, the Claude Code translation logic lives inline in `install.sh`. This directory is the future home for extracted, modular translation configs.

**Output paths:** `.claude/roles/*.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
