# OpenClaw Target

Translation rules for generating OpenClaw container-based agent teams from platform-agnostic expert definitions.

This target will support Docker-based deployment of coordinated expert teams using the OpenClaw runtime. Expected artifacts:

- `AGENTS.md` and routing bindings per expert
- `Dockerfile` templates for agent containers
- `docker-compose.yml` for multi-agent orchestration
- Matrix room configuration for inter-agent communication

**Status:** Planned. See `docs/overview.md` for the team mode vision.
