<!-- TEMPLATE: Interview Skill
     This is the first skill in your expert. It pulls context from the user's
     head through a structured interview. The output becomes the raw material for
     the /brief skill.

     Customize the categories below to match your domain. The existing experts
     use 5-7 categories. Each category should probe a different dimension of the
     project/task.

     Examples:
       SWE uses: Problem, Audience, Success, Scope, Constraints, Prior Art, Risks
       EDA uses: Application Domain, then interview about Data, Questions, Goals

     Replace {{INTERVIEW_SKILL}} with your skill name (e.g., "brainstorm", "intake").
     Replace {{NOTES_DOC}} with the output file (e.g., "brainstorm-notes.md", "intake-notes.md").
     Delete these comments when done.

The user is starting a new {{EXPERT_NAME}} project and needs help defining what they want to accomplish.

If the user provided a description: $ARGUMENTS

Interview them about this project, one category at a time, in this order:

<!-- GUIDE: Replace these categories with ones appropriate to your domain.
     Keep 5-7 categories. Order them from big-picture to specific. -->

1. **Goals** — What are you trying to achieve? What does success look like?
2. **Context** — What's the current situation? What exists already?
3. **Audience** — Who is this for? What do they care about?
4. **Scope** — What's in and what's explicitly out?
5. **Constraints** — Timeline, budget, tools, skills, organizational limitations?
6. **Prior Art** — What's been tried? What similar things exist? What can we learn from them?
7. **Risks** — What could go wrong? What's most uncertain?

Rules:
- Ask questions one-at-a-time per category, then WAIT for answers before moving on.
- If an answer is vague, push back and ask for specifics.
- After all categories, produce a structured summary and flag any contradictions or gaps.
- Save the summary to `docs/{{NOTES_DOC}}`.
