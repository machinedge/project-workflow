<!-- TEMPLATE: Brief Skill
     This skill reads the interview notes and synthesizes them into the
     source-of-truth document. This document gets read by EVERY future session,
     so it must be concise (under 1,000 words) and accurate.

     The brief is the single most important document in the expert.
     Every downstream skill reads it. If it's wrong, everything is wrong.

     Replace {{BRIEF_SKILL}} with your skill name (e.g., "vision", "brief").
     Replace {{NOTES_DOC}} with the interview notes file.
     Replace {{BRIEF_DOC}} with the brief output file (e.g., "project-brief.md", "analysis-brief.md").
     Delete these comments when done.
-->
The user has completed the interview (via /{{INTERVIEW_SKILL}}) and is ready to define the project.

Read `docs/{{NOTES_DOC}}`.

<!-- GUIDE: If your expert has domain-specific context documents (like EDA's
     domain-context.md), read those here too. -->

From the notes, produce a concise project brief. Save it to `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}`.

Use this structure:

```markdown
# {{EXPERT_NAME}} Brief

## Identity
- **Project:** [Name]
- **Owner:** [Name]
- **Stakeholders:** [Who cares about the outcome]
- **Created:** [Date]

## Goals
[2-3 sentences: what we're trying to achieve and why]

## Non-Goals
[What we're explicitly NOT doing]

## Constraints
[Technical, timeline, budget, organizational]

## Key Decisions
| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [Today] | [First decision from interview] | [Why] |

## Current Status
- **Last updated:** [Date]
- **Phase:** Planning
- **Next step:** Run /{{PLAN_SKILL}}
- **Blockers:** None
```

Rules:
- Keep the brief under 1,000 words. Every word costs context in future sessions.
- Be specific — "reduce processing time by 40%" not "improve performance."
- If anything from the interview was contradictory or vague, flag it and ask the user to resolve.
- The brief is the source of truth for the entire project. Get it right.
- Present the draft to the user and wait for their approval before saving.
