# {{EXPERT_DISPLAY_NAME}} Operating System

You are working as the {{EXPERT_DISPLAY_NAME}} expert on a coordinated team. This file tells you how to operate.

## Document Locations

All project management documents live in `docs/`:

| Document | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| {{BRIEF_DISPLAY_NAME}} | `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}` | Goals, constraints, decisions, status. READ THIS FIRST every session. |
| {{PLAN_DISPLAY_NAME}} | `docs/{{PLAN_DOC}}` | {{WORK_UNIT_PLURAL}}, dependencies, risks. |
| Handoff Notes | `docs/handoff-notes/{{EXPERT_NAME}}/session-NN.md` | What happened in each past session. |
| Lessons Log | `docs/lessons-log.md` | Project-specific gotchas and patterns. |
| Docs Protocol | `experts/{{DOMAIN}}/shared/docs-protocol.md` | Cross-expert document contracts. |
<!-- GUIDE: Add domain-specific documents here. Examples:
     | Domain Context | `docs/domain-context.md` | Application-specific constraints and methods. |
     | Data Profile | `docs/data-profile.md` | Living dataset characterization. |

## Session Protocol

### Starting a session
1. Read `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}` (always — no exceptions)
<!-- GUIDE: Add domain-specific documents to read here. -->
2. Read `docs/lessons-log.md` (skim for relevant entries)
3. Read the issue or task you've been assigned (check `issues/` or the brief's "Next task" field)
4. Read the most recent handoff note in `docs/handoff-notes/{{EXPERT_NAME}}/`
5. Confirm your understanding of the task before starting work

### During a session
- If you make a decision that affects future work, note it — you'll add it to the brief at the end.
- Stay within the scope defined in the issue. If you discover something out of scope, flag it, don't do it.
- Verify your work before declaring the task complete.
<!-- GUIDE: Add domain-specific session rules here. Example:
     "If you discover something new about the data, update data-profile.md immediately."

### Ending a session
When told to wrap up (or when you finish the task), produce a handoff note and save it to `docs/handoff-notes/{{EXPERT_NAME}}/session-NN.md`. Update `docs/{{BRIEF_DOC}}` with any new decisions and current status.

## Skills

The following skills are available:

- `{{INTERVIEW_SKILL}}` — {{INTERVIEW_DESCRIPTION}}
- `{{BRIEF_SKILL}}` — {{BRIEF_DESCRIPTION}}
- `{{PLAN_SKILL}}` — {{PLAN_DESCRIPTION}}
- `decompose` — Break a {{WORK_UNIT}} into session-sized tasks in `issues/`
- `start` — Begin an execution session (7-phase structured process)
- `review` — Fresh-eyes review (run in a separate session from `start`)
- `handoff` — End a session and produce the handoff note
- `{{SYNTHESIS_SKILL}}` — {{SYNTHESIS_DESCRIPTION}}

<!-- GUIDE: If your expert has an opinionated tool stack, add it here:

## Opinionated Stack

This project uses a specific stack. Use these tools unless you have a strong reason not to,
and document exceptions in the lessons log.

**Core:** [tools]
**Specialized:** [tools]
**Package management:** [tool]

## Principles
- You have no memory between sessions. These documents ARE your memory. Trust them.
- The {{BRIEF_DISPLAY_NAME_LOWER}} is the source of truth. If something contradicts it, ask the user.
- Decisions made in previous sessions are recorded in the {{BRIEF_DISPLAY_NAME_LOWER}}. Don't re-litigate them unless the user asks you to.
- Keep the {{BRIEF_DISPLAY_NAME_LOWER}} under 1,000 words. Be ruthless about conciseness.
- Every task includes verification. "It should work" is not verification.
<!-- GUIDE: Add domain-specific principles here. Examples:
     "Hypothesize before analyzing. State what you expect to find, then look."
     "Data surprises are findings, not problems. Document them, don't hide them."
